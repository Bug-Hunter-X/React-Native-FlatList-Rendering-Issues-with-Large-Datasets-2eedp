# React Native FlatList Rendering Issues with Large Datasets

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using the `FlatList` component in React Native with large datasets.  The bug manifests as blank rows or incorrect rendering during rapid scrolling.

The provided code (`FlatListBug.js`) reproduces the issue.  The solution (`FlatListBugSolution.js`) demonstrates how to fix it using appropriate key extraction and potentially optimizing data rendering.

**Bug:**

Blank rows appear or content updates inconsistently during fast scrolling of the FlatList.

**Solution:**

The solution focuses on implementing the `keyExtractor` prop correctly and potentially using techniques like `getItemLayout` to improve rendering performance.

This is a common problem that highlights the importance of efficient data handling and optimized rendering in React Native when dealing with extensive lists.
